Each row is uniquely identified by order_item_id and is tightly linked to the parent orders record via order_id and to the master products catalog through product_id. A boolean-style flag is_primary_item lets analysts quickly isolate the main product in bundles or multi-item carts. Cost and revenue are captured in parallel currencies\u2014USD and INR\u2014so finance can track both top-line price_usd/price_inr and bottom-line cost-of-goods-sold (cogs_usd/cogs_inr) for margin analysis. The created_at timestamp marks when the line item was inserted, which is usually within seconds of checkout. In short, this table answers \u201cWhat exactly did the customer buy, what did we charge, and what did it cost us?\u201d",

Its primary key, order_id, ties together the customer (user_id), their web session (session_id), and the single product flagged as the primary purchase driver (primary_product_id). The row also caches the total number of distinct items purchased and the full order value and cost in both USD and INR, eliminating the need to recalculate from line items for quick reporting. A created_at timestamp records the exact checkout moment, enabling cohort and daily revenue analytics. Orders therefore serve as the central aggregation point\u2014linking user behavior captured in sessions to the granular line items and ultimately to refunds if any are issued.",

The pageview_url field holds the full relative path, allowing analysts to slice by landing pages, product SKUs, or checkout steps.
